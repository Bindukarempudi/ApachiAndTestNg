Logging-record all events in the form of text

Why we need logs?
suppose we r running 100s of testcases some time fail or skip or pass  and 
u have to know where exactly it will fail why it failed
those information are all in log file


we can log automation logs and application logs

Log Levels - All < Trace < Debug < Info < Warn < Error < Fatal < Off


Appenders - where to generate logs (Console/File)
Loggers  - what type of logs generate 
           (All < Trace < Debug < Info < Warn < Error < Fatal < Off)
